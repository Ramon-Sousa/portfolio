  "subtitle": "Stock and supply counting is an essential activity in restaurant kitchens. Our solution revolutionizes this process by centralizing inventory management, replacing paper, pen, and spreadsheets with technology. Now, counting is done in a practical and accurate manner using QR codes on labels, ensuring a more efficient, modern operation fully integrated into the daily kitchen workflow.",

One of the main contributing factors was the warning modal displayed when scanning an already registered label. In some cases, this alert interrupted the userâ€™s journey, making the experience less seamless."
